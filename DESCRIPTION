Description: Generating evaluation plots on the performance of using different
    training-test data split ratios in linear regression machine learning model,
    as well as on performance using different resampling strategies on binary
    classification machine learning task. The function eval_split_ratio() looks
    the performance of linear regression models with training data share from 
    10% to 90% by 10% steps, results in box-plot showing the relationship 
    between different between share of training data and the mean squared error 
    of prediction. The function rsmp_mce() uses logistic regression to solve 
    the binary classification task and then compare different 
    miss-classification errors on test data using the following re-sampling 
    strategies: 1) three times ten-fold cross validation (3x10 CV); 
    2) ten times three-fold cross validation (10x3 CV); 
    3) a singe holdout split with 90% training data.
